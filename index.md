¡Hola! I am Fernán González Ibáñez. I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Granada, under the supervision of José María Espinar and Joaquín Pérez. Previously, I earned a Master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Münster, supervised by Rudolf Zeidler, and a Master’s in Mathematical Research from the Polytechnic University of Valencia. I completed my Bachelor’s degree at Universitat Jaume I (Castellón), where I wrote my thesis under the guidance of Vicent Gimeno i García.

My research focuses on differential geometry—particularly geometric analysis and minimal surfaces—and I also have a strong interest in scientific computing and programming.

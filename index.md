¡Hola! I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Granada. Previously I completed a master in mathematics in the University of Münster under the supervision of Rudolf Zeidler and previously I did a master in Mathematical Research in Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and I completed my bachelor in the Universitat Jaume I of Castellón where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Vicent Gimeno i Garcia. I am interested in differential geometry, mainly geometric analysis and minimal surfaces. Also I am interested in scientific computing and programming.
